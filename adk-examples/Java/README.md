&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii) `ADKConnectorLive.java` <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_If you want to work with Historical data open up &nbsp;`ADKConnectorHist.java` and for live
input and &nbsp;&nbsp; output open up the `ADKConnectorLive.java`._ <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;method inside the **main** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class.<br>
