# Falkonry ADK Example - Java
#### This Example App can be used to refer and build some cool and powerful applications using the Falkonry ADK.

### Usage:-

**1)** Open up the **_falkonryadk/src/main/java/_** folder.<br>

**2)** Inside this folder, there are two `Java` files:-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i) `ADKConnectorHist.java` <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii) `ADKConnectorLive.java` <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_If you want to work with Historical data open up &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`ADKConnectorHist.java` and for live
input and output open up the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`ADKConnectorLive.java`._ <br>

**3)** You can use our code as it has been explained inside our files and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there are also docs for each method inside the `ADKConnHist class`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the `ADKConn class` which ever in use and also examples of each
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;method inside the **main** class.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Note:-** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside the `ADKConnHist class ` and the `ADKConn class` present in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`ADKConnectorHist.java` and `ADKConnectorLive.java` files
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respectively you need to add the **URL and API Token** provided to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you by the Falkonry Team.

**4)** After editing the code according to your application just use the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Run` option in any premier IDE (Integrated Development
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environment) for Java and it will prompt you to select a particular &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class.
